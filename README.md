# Ideal-Crop-Selection-in-a-Specific-Location
The whole system has been integrated to give an overall view of the soil conditions and the environment.
Taking certain parameters into consideration, related sensors have been used to extract the actual value 
of those chosen parameters in specific locations. Then comparison has been made along with a set of 
preset values to give an output as to which crop would be ideal to be planted in that specific location 
where the tests had been carried out.
